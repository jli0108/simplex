Simple Implementation of Simplex Method using Tableaus

## Notes
This implementation assumes you want to solve a maximization problem in canonical form.

That is, you want to maximize c^T x given constraints Ax <= b and x >= 0.

I think the implementation avoids degeneracy, but I have not tested it.

## Requirements
This implementation requires [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/).

## Usage
